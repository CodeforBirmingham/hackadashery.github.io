Questions for Tim/Graham/Amanda

Who will be using the dashboard

What are the top (3) most important information users will need to see right away?

What are the next 3 most important pieces of information users need to see?

Is it possible for us to get our data analysts more data then what is a current available to the public?

What are the different departments?

Is there information you need to see across the all departments?

Is there information you need to see specific to each department?

Is there information you need to see about one department that you wouldnâ€™t need to know about other departments?

Do you ever look at specific types of tickets? For example, just looking at abandoned cars or just looking at fallen trees?

What is the process for reporting completed tickets?

Is there ever lag time between completing a ticket and it being recorded in the system?

Are tickets reopened if a resident calls up to say the issue has not been resolved to their satisfaction? Or is a new ticket created?

Is there currently a way to connect 2 tickets that are repeats? So if someone calls up about a fallen tree and someone else calls about that same fallen tree are they connected in the system currently?
